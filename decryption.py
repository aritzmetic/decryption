# Delera, Aritz B.
# decryptor

# Create an introduction
# Use while loop for a condition-controlled loop
# Ask the name of the user to create a greeting
# ask the user to input the encrypted text
# Make a decryption class that we will be using for the program
# we need to initialize the instance variable
# create a method to decrypt the encrypted text
# check if the character matches any of the substitution characters, Change '*' to 'a'
# Change '&' to 'e'
# Change '#' to 'i'
# Change '+' to 'o'
# Change '!' to 'u'
# Put the character in place if it isn't a replacement character
# return the decrypted text
# make a new instance of the Decrypter class using the encrypted text
# use the decrypter() method and save the decrypted text
# print out the decrypted text
# Ask the user if they want to repeat the process
# If the user doesn't want to repeat the process, exit the loop
