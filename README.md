## **INTRODUCTION**
> _This is a Python program that is designed to decrypt encrypted text that has been encoded using a substitution cipher. The method involves replacing the encrypted characters with their corresponding plaintext characters._

## **Attributes**
- > a **salutation** for the user
- > The program **contains a loop** that enables the user to decrypt numerous encrypted texts.
- > A **class** that has a decryption method included in it.
- > A **specific instance** of the decryption class is created to decipher the text inputted by the user. Once the decryption process is complete, the resulting text is displayed on the console.
- > The user is **presented with a choice** to either repeat the current process or terminate the program.
- > The practice of enhancing the appearance of messages through the use of **ASCII art and colored text.**

## **How to run this program using IDE?**
> 1. Run the program in a Python IDE or command line.
> 2. The program greets the user and requests their name.
> 3. Enter the encrypted text to decrypt.
> 4. The program will then build a Decryption class object and use the decrypter() method to decrypt the user's text.
> Console will display decrypted text.
> 5. User will be requested to repeat process. if Yes, the program returns to step 3. if No, the program closes.
